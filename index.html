								<p>My name is Josh Thornton and I have a passion for computers, be it using them, building them or writing code for them. I also take the occasional photograph. I am 18 and was born and raised in the Dandenong Ranges. I completed Year 12 at Monbulk College in 2018, where I studied Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Studio Arts and 'Creative and Digital Media'. </p>
								<p>My main hobby is playing video games. I'm a big Nintendo fan and have been playing their games my whole life. In fact, one of the first video games I ever played was Super Mario 64. I am currently completing my Master Mode playthrough of Breath of the Wild and am playing Smash Ultimate way too much. </p> 
								<p>Although I am a big Nintendo fan, my favourite game of all time actually had nothing to do with them. The title of my favourite game is 'Final Fantasy IX', which was released on the PS1 in 2000. As far as I know, it might have been the first game I ever played, and I still play through it every year or two.</p>
								
								
								
								<h3>Personality Testing</h3>
							  <p>After taking a Myers-Briggs personality test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">16personalities.com</a>, I found out that I'm a 'Logistician', meaning that I am the type of person to face facts rather than be influenced by emotions, but I also have some introverted tendencies. 
							 <br> Another test I have taken is a 'Big Five' personality test, the results of which can be obtained <a href="https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/results/?o=38,75,75&c=75,56,69&e=44,63,44&a=81,81,69&n=44,25,44&y=2000&g=m">here</a>. <br> A third test that I have taken is a learning style test from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">this website</a> where I was classified as a visual learner.</p>
							 <p>Personally, I believe all three of these tests to be almost entirely irrelevant, and I would argue that my classification as a visual learner is useless, as I know none who can truly understand something just by observing.<br> I also believe the only result that would ever matter when working in with a team is an individual's level of introversion, how comfortable they are working with others.</p>
							
							<p>I don't believe that these results will influence my behaviour in a team in any way. Once I get comfortable cooperating with people, I lose my introverted tendencies, contrary to what my test results indicate. Additionally, inferring one's behaviour on an internet-based test is irresponsible in my opinion, as I believe people are dynamic by nature, they can change their own personality for the benefit of others</p>
							
							 <p>When forming a team with anybody, I would not heed these results much at all, I would much prefer to get to know people before I disregard them as unsuitable for my team. That being said, when forming a team, it is important to include people with varying personalities that do not conflict with each other. Forming a team where every member is an introvert can hinder communication amongst the group, whereas if every member was an extrovert it may lead to everyone talking over each other and nothing actually being accomplished. </p>

								<h2 class="major">My IT Passion</h2>
								
								<p>As far back as I can remember, I've had an interest in computers, which eventually developed into an interest in IT.</p>
								<p>My interest was sparked when I was very young, maybe 2 or 3, when I used to play N64. I started playing different games on different systems throughout my childhood. Once I got my first computer, a new world opened before me, I was able to start messing around with programs and games that other people had made.</p>
								<p>Due to lack of time, I have unfortunately been unable to pursue greater knowledge in this field until now, but I am thoroughly enjoying every minute of my studies.</p>
								
								<p>I chose to enrol at RMIT because of the university's location and reputation as well as its strong reputation for tech-related studies. During my time studying at RMIT, I naturally expect to obtain degree, but I also expect to receive knowledge that can be applied far beyond the scope of just a single degree. I aim to learn how to better apply myself to tasks and to better understand how I can work in a new environment.</p>

							  <p>Within the next 5 years, I believe my ideal job to be <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/82102238182286022/">this one</a> at Google.</p>
								<p>In this career, I would be required to develop and improve upon existing technologies offered by Google. I would get the opportunity to collaborate with other to build projects such as artificial intelligence, data compression, machine learning and search technologies. I’m particularly interested in the artificial intelligence and machine learning aspects of the job, I am intrigued by these fields and I would love to be involved in their development. </p>
								<p>To qualify for the position, a level of education greater than or equal to a Bachelor’s is required. Additional requirements include knowledge in programming languages such as Java and Python, and experience working with different operating systems.</p>
								<p>I do, however, currently have experience working with Linux, macOS and Windows, with some understanding of their respective command line interfaces. I also have minor experience with Java, which I aim to improve upon, while also gaining experience with other programming languages.</p>
								<p>While my current studies will grant me the minimum requirements to qualify for the position, and provides knowledge in Java-based programming, receiving a degree of greater value such as a Master’s or PhD would increase my chance of being accepted into the position. </p>
								<p></p>
								<p>After I earn my Bachelor's degree, I aim to continue studying this field and obtain a Master's degree from RMIT. Ideally, this will increase the chance of my application being accepted. </p>

								<h2 class="major">My IT Project Concept</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutPic.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My IT project idea is a mobile application that assists learner drivers in logging their time driving. It would be a replacement to the current pen and paper method VicRoads requires learners to use currently. It would also serve as a hub to access free and paid driving lessons, granting learners easy access to these resources.</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>When writing my hours down in my personal logbook, I realised how much simpler it would be to complete my required hours if the process was largely automated with the assistance of a mobile device. The pen and paper method can be frustrating as I sometimes accidentally write a single incorrect number and am forced to re-write the whole entry, a mobile application would allow me to quickly correct these mistakes, which is something that I’m sure many learner drivers would appreciate.</p>

								<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The app will be a complete replacement for VicRoads’ (and potentially other state road governors) current learner driver processes. Leveraging the services provided by a user’s smart device such as system clock and location, the app will automatically log the user’s driving until they qualify to undertake their P plates test. The app will feature a simple interface in which the user can add teacher drivers, manually enter driving information and receive information about services such as driving lessons and other useful knowledge. </p>

								<p>Google Maps or Apple Maps integration would also be ideal, providing driving and direction information to the user.</p>

<p>Upon first launching the app, the user will be prompted to enter their information; name, address, learner permit number, etc.), if they do not currently have a learner’s permit, they will be directed to their local state’s learner test service. </p>
<p>After verifying their identity, users will be asked to enter the driver’s license number of their supervisors, as well as the registration of the cars they will be driving. Users will be able to add to this information at any time.</p>

<p>Once the user has entered required information, they may begin a ‘journey’, where the app will log how far and for how long the user drives, logging driving conditions such as weather and levels of traffic.</p>

							
							
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>The app will rely on the user’s smart phone or potentially a vehicle equipped with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Using a device’s built-in location services and system clock, the app can determine how long a driver has driven and how far. An interactive front-end and a backend would be created to facilitate usage of the app.</p>

								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>Knowledge in a mobile-friendly programming language would be required, unless the app was built using services such as Google’s App Maker or MIT App Inventor. Strong understanding of User Centred Design concepts would also be necessary to create a good user experience within the app. Fulfilling these requirements seems to be very feasible, as I am currently taking courses in the requirements.</p>
<p>Sourcing compatible devices to conduct testing will also be quite simple, as I have access to a multitude of devices including Android phones and tablets, as well as iOS devices.</p>

								<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, it will be pitched to VicRoads as an alternative to their current methods of logging driving time, in the hopes of licensing it to them. It will solve the problem of the clunky pen and paper method by providing automation and ease of use.</p>
